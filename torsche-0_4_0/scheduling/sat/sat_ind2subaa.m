function [out] = sat_ind2subaa (index, asap, alap, K)
%SAT_SUB2IND convert marking of boolean variable in from
%            Xm to Xijk. Time line is compoud only from asap to alap.
%
%    [i j k] = SAT_IND2SUBAA(index, ASAP, ALAP, K) return index of boolean variable.
%      i     - task index
%      j     - time
%      k     - procesor index
%      index - order of boolean variable
%      ASAP  - array with asap
%      ALAP  - array with alap
%      K     - number of procesors
