function [out] = sat_ind2sub (index, J, K)
%SAT_SUB2IND convert marking of boolean variable in from
%            Xm to Xijk
%
%    [i j k] = SAT_IND2SUB(index, J, K) return index of boolean variable.
%      i - task index
%      j - time
%      k - procesor index
%      m - order of boolean variable
%      J - max time
%      K - number of procesors
%
%    Index m is computed as m = (i-1)KJ+(k-1)J+j + K*(i-1)+k
%    Topology order of index m is: 1 0 1, 1 1 1, ..., 1 J 1, 1 0 2,
%      1 1 2, ..., 1 J 2, ..., 1 J K, 2 0 1, ..., 2 J 1, ..., 2 J K, ...
