function varargout = between(G,varargin)
%BETWEEN   Return number of edges between initial and terminal node of
%graph or number of initial and terminal node of the edge
%
% Syntax
%    edge = BETWEEN(G,IN,TN)
%     edge  - number of edge
%     G     - graph
%     IN    - number of initial node
%     TN    - number of terminal node
%
%    [IN,TN] = BETWEEN(G,edge)
