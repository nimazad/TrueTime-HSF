%DIJKSTRA finds the shortest path between reference node and other nodes in
%graph.
%
% Synopsis
%   DISTANCE = DIJKSTRA(GRAPH,STARTNODE,USERPARAMPOSITION)
%
% Description
%  Parameters:
%    GRAPH:
%      - graph with cost betweens nodes
%      - type inf when edge between two edges does not exist
%    STARTNODE:
%      - reference node
%    USERPARAMPOSITION:
%      - position in UserParam of Nodes where number representative color
%        is saved. This parameter is optional. Default is 1. 
%    DISTANCE:
%      - list of distances between reference node and other nodes
