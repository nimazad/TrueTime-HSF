function st = spanningtree(g,varargin)
%SPANNINGTREE finds spanning tree of the graph
%
% Synopsis
%   ST = SPANNINGTREE(GRAPH,USERPARAMPOSITION)
%
% Description
%    GRAPH     - graph with costs between nodes
%              - type inf when edge between two edges does not exist
%    USERPARAMPOSITION - position in UserParam of Nodes where number
%                representative color is saved. This parameter is
%                optional. Default is 1.
%    ST        - matrix which represetnts minimals body of the graph
%
%  See also GRAPH/GRAPH, GRAPH/DIJKSTRA.
