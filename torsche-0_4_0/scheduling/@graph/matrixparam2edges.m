function g = matrixparam2edges(g,param,varargin)
%MATRIXPARAM2EDGES assigns user parameters to graph.
%    G = EDGES2PARAM(G,USERPARAM) assigns to user param
%    (UserParam) of edges in graph G data from matrix USERPARAM.
%
%    G = EDGES2PARAM(G,USERPARAM,N) assigns the data to 
%    N-th position in UserParam.
%
%    G = EDGES2PARAM(G,USERPARAM,N,NOTEDGEPARAM) defines value of
%    user parameter for missing edges. This value is used for checking 
%    consistence between graph G and matrix USERPARAM (default is INF).
%
%  See also PARAM2EDGES, GRAPH, EDGES2MATRIXPARAM.
