function isNegCyclic = isnegativecyclic(g,varargin)
%ISNEGATIVECYCLIC   True for cyclic graph with negative cycle
%
%       ISNEGATIVECYCLIC(G) returns 1 if G is a graph containing negative
%       cycle and 0 otherwise. Graph G can be represented by object GRAPH.
%
%       ISNEGATIVECYCLIC(G,'pos',N) defines position in edges' UserParam
%       (default is N = 1).
%
%       ISNEGATIVECYCLIC(graph,ADJ) returns logical 1 if ADJ represents graph
%       containing negative cycle and logical 0 otherwise. ADJ is
%       "adjacency" matrix with costs of edges.
%
%       ISNEGATIVECYCLIC(graph,ADJ,VALUE) defines value of cost for missing
%       edges (default is INF).
