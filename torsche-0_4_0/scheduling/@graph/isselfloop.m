function isSelfLoop = isselfloop(g,varargin)
%ISSELFLOOP   True for graph with loop.
%
%       ISSELFLOOP(G) returns logical 1 if G has loop and logical 0
%       otherwise. Graph G must be represented as object GRAPH.
%
%       ISSELFLOOP(graph,ADJ) returns logical 1 if ADJ represents graph
%       with loop and logical 0 otherwise. ADJ is adjacency matrix of
%       graph.
