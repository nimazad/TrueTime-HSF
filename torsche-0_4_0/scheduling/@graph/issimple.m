function isSimple = issimple(g,varargin)
%ISSIMPLE   True for simple graph (graph without parallel edges)
%
%       ISSIMPLE(G) returns 1 if G is a simple graph and 0 otherwise.
%       Graph G can be represented by object GRAPH or adjacency matrix.
%
%       ISSIMPLE(graph,ADJ) returns logical 1 if ADJ represents graph
%       without parallel edges and logical 0 otherwise. ADJ is adjacency
%       matrix of graph.
