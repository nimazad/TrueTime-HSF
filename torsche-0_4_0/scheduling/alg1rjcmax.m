%ALG1RJCMAX computes schedule with Earliest Release Date First algorithm 
%
% Synopsis
%   TS = alg1rjcmax(T, problem)
%
% Description
%	TS = alg1rjcmax(T, problem) finds schedule of the scheduling problem 1|rj|Cmax.
%   Parameters:
%    T:
%      - input set of tasks
%    TS:
%      - set of tasks with a schedule
%    PROBLEM:
%      - description of scheduling problem (object PROBLEM) - '1|rj|Cmax'
