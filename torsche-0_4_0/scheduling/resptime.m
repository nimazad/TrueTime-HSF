function [R, schedulable]=resptime(taskset)
% resptime - algoritm Response Time Equation for a set of periodic tasks
%	R = resptime(taskset) is a row vector where R(i) is worst-case
%       response time of i-th task of the taskset. The tasks are scheduled by fixed
%       priority scheduller
%   Syntax:
%        RESPTIME(taskset)
%               taskset - set of periodic tasks
